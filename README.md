# Social-Network-API
This is my attempt at creating the social network API. 
Unfortunately none of my code works for this project as I kept running into errors.
I tried troubleshooting many of the errors for hours with no success. 
I know that I am close to making it work unfortunately I have to submit this project as is. 
It seems I might be running into circular dependencies disallowing me to successfully start the server. 
I also get invalid values even though I've changed the way I define them multiple times, so apparently I am doing something wrong.
